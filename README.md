## Project Architecture
The **RealEstateQuery** application follows a modular architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

- **Frontend:** 
  - React.js components handle user interactions and render dynamic content.
  - Communicates with backend APIs via HTTP requests.

- **Backend:** 
  - Built with Node.js and Express.js to handle business logic and serve data from the database.
  - Exposes RESTful API endpoints for property data, user authentication, and analytics.

- **Database:** 
  - PostgreSQL stores structured data such as property listings, user profiles, saved searches, and financial metrics.

- **Hosting Environment:** 
  - The application is hosted on an Ubuntu Linux desktop using Nginx as a reverse proxy for secure access.

- **APIs:** 
  - Integrates external APIs (e.g., Google Maps API) for map visualizations and geolocation services.


---

## Data Sources
The application relies on multiple data sources to provide comprehensive commercial real estate insights:

1. **Google Maps API**:
   - Provides geolocation services, interactive maps, and nearby points of interest.

2. **Zillow API (or similar)**:
   - Supplies property listings, pricing data, and market trends.

3. **Internal Dataset**:
   - Mock or real-world data for testing purposes, including historical transactions or financial metrics.

4. **User Input**:
   - Data from users such as saved searches, contact inquiries, or custom filters.

## Testing
Testing ensures the reliability and functionality of the application across its components:

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Backend APIs are tested using Jest to verify individual endpoints function correctly.
   - Example: Test that property search filters return accurate results.

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Cypress is used for end-to-end testing of interactions between frontend components and backend APIs.
   - Example: Test that a search query from the frontend retrieves correct results from the database.

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Perform manual tests on Linux-hosted instances to ensure responsiveness across devices (desktop/mobile).
   - Example: Verify that maps load correctly on different browsers.

4. **How to Run Tests:**
  - ```{terminal}npm test```
  - Or run integration tests with:
  - ```{terminal}npx cypress open```
